Landlorder
----------

A small and buggy web client in Ruby on Rails / Postgresql / Twitter Bootstrap for the game [Landlord][2]

Easy to deploy on Heroku.
The app uses Foursquare connect.
Set api key and secret in config/initializers/foursquare.rb (copy config/initializers/foursquare.rb.model)

What you can do :

- explore venues price at a distance (from you browser)
- buy venues wherever you are :-) this is a called cheating !
- get a snapshot of your all properties in a sortable table
- more...

ONce connected with Foursquare, you will need to find a way to get your Landlord userId and auth token...
Use a proxy like Charles or any other way to sniff the http requests headers going in and out of your iphone.
