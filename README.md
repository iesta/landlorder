Landlorder
----------

A small and buggy web client in Ruby on Rails / Postgresql / Twitter Bootstrap for the game [Landlord][2]

Easy to deploy on Heroku. Uses Foursquare connect. Api keys needed.

- explore venues price at a distance
- buy venues wherever you are :-)
- get a snapshot of your all properties in a sortable table

You will need to find a way to get your Landlord userId and auth token... 
Use a proxy like Charles or any other way to sniff the http requests going in and out of your iphone.
